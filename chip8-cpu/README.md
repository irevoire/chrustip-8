# Chip 8 CPU

The implementation of the chip 8 CPU is made in this repository as a library.

## Documentation
```
cargo rustdoc --open
```

Also, since I know this code will mostly be read (if ever) by people learning how to do an emulator like me you should consider the next command which will also build the documentation of all the chip8 instruction:
```
cargo rustdoc --open -- --document-private-items
```

The best documentation remains here: http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM#Fx1E
